4,"I'd rate it 7 out of 10. This device offers great value for the price, especially with its excellent OS, impressive battery life, and stylish design. However, the rear camera is below average, the selfie camera is poor, and there was some initial lag during setup. It's a solid choice for those seeking a genuine Android experience but not recommended for photo enthusiasts."

4,"The much-awaited CMF Phone 1 looks better than the pictures.Pros:The colour is a beautiful  deep navy blue. It's also rather large. The display is very, very bright. The flat screen is a great plus point for me. That little dial is an attractive design feature for now.Thanks to Flipkart for the superfast delivery of the phone. Wish the accesories had been delivered together as well. The phone was launched at 12 noon. It was in my hands by six pm!Cons: The edges of the phone are very ..."

5,Excellent product
5,"Amazing for the price. Nothing os is just so smooth. Feels like I am using ios. Performance is very good as it is a 4nm based chip.Camera is decent for the price. Best user experience in this price segment for sure. In-hand feel is also good, however people with smaller hands might face difficulty in adapting to it as it is boxy in design and screen is wider. Overall, can't complain about the product for the price it is available. Some people who are unnecessary hating on this phone need to e..."
5,Given the price range- it's a steal. Am coming from the likes of Iphones and oneplus devices. Had used Nothing phone (2) as well. On this particular device I did not find anything that would want me to go back to other mobiles. ..simply superb ! A new Value prop device. First of its kind. Way to go Nothing !!
5,Most Stylish and Affordable Phone
5,Overall 4.5/5
3,Power packed one in decent price. Camera could be better and Absence of nfc bit disappointed. On hand looking not as much a premium look. Plastic toy brought by 16005INR 128/8GB
3,Very nice
5,"Nice mobile, but CMF should give charging adapter. Overall mobile performance very good."
5,Great Mobile 📱The CMF Phone 1 not only features a lot of good stuff at a reasonable asking price but also flaunts a unique eye-catching design that everyone is curious about.
4,"Phone feel is good for the segment. 120hz screen is smooth. OS has slight learning curve. Camera is very average. Should have given 256gb option.🙁 Matt plastic in the back is initially slippery which takes few days to get used to. Should have given in the box, safety back cover."
