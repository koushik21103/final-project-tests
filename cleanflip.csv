However, the rear camera is below average, the selfie camera is poor, and there was some initial lag during setup. Its a solid choice for those seeking a genuine Android experience but not recommended for photo enthusiasts."

4,"Phone feel is good for the segment. 120hz screen is smooth. OS has slight learning curve. Camera is very average. Should have given 256gb option. Matt plastic in the back is initially slippery which takes few days to get used to. Should have given in the box, safety back cover."

Wish the accesories had been delivered together as well. The phone was launched at 12 noon. It was in my hands by six pmCons The edges of the phone are very ..."

5,"Amazing for the price. Nothing os is just so smooth. Feels like I am using ios. Performance is very good as it is a 4nm based chip.Camera is decent for the price. Best user experience in this price segment for sure. Inhand feel is also good, however people with smaller hands might face difficulty in adapting to it as it is boxy in design and screen is wider. Overall, cant complain about the product for the price it is available. Some people who are unnecessary hating on this phone need to e..."
