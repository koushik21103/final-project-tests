4,"Id rate it 7 out of 10. This device offers great value for the price, especially with its excellent OS, impressive battery life, and stylish design. However, the rear camera is below average, the selfie camera is poor, and there was some initial lag during setup. Its a solid choice for those seeking a genuine Android experience but not recommended for photo enthusiasts.",0.081,0.729,0.19,0.768
